# Welcome to the 30 Days of JavaScript Solutions docs contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be crucial for other students to learn from.

The Code of conduct is simple.

- Please no derogatory statement to people
- Treat people with utmost respect

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the README.

## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, the JavaScript files are saved according to the day you are working on.

- For day1 it is day1.js
- For day2 it is day2.js and so on.

Please send a message on the day you will be working on, so that don't duplicate efforts.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Please don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout any git tutorial to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues. I will recommend the Udacity git course.
